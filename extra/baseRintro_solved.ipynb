So far we have been able to get by with functions that come with a default installation and a fresh R session. Only the most basic packages are automatically enabled - these include what we call 'base' R functions (i.e. what we have focused on in this notebook).\n",

More (roughly 14 000 at the time of writing this) are available on CRAN, the main repository of R packages. These need to be installed first using for example the function `install.packages()` (or one of the menu items when using some UI), and again taken in to use with the `library()` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "The abundance of packages is overwhelming. In practice, however, we end up using only a limited selection that matches our needs. To avoid getting lost, you can use the traditional methods of asking colleagues, and searching the Internet for advice and practical examples. For another good resource, you can have a look at Task Views on the [CRAN home page](http://cran.r-project.org/). These are curated lists of packages related to a certain field of study, with short explanations of which functions perform which tasks.\n",

Hopefully you have learned enough of the basics to start learning more on your own, or be able to tell what is going on if you are faced with a colleague's R script. You can actually test this: scroll back to the very beginning of this notebook, to the first code cell. You should be able to tell a function from an assignment etc. You will see some unfamiliar function calls but you should know how to bring up their documentation to see what they do. Another thing you can try: search for a method or task familiar to you and add \"with R\" to the search, see what you find... and see if you can understand the R code part of the content.\n",

    "Of course, consider installing both R and RStudio on your own computer. Note that they are two different things: R is provided by CRAN and comes with its own (very basic) interface. RStudio is an alternative user interface provided by the RStudio company. The open-source version of RStudio can be downloaded for free.\n",

    "Using RStudio efficiently is its own separate learning objective and is intertwined with learning how to use a collection of packages called __tidyverse__, also provided by the RStudio company. See the [tidyverse website](www.tidyverse.org) for more information and the book 'R for Data Science' linked there. These packages have an underlying philosophy that slightly differs from base R, so prepare to relearn a few things. Watch videos, read through tutorials, take a course online or offline. It'll be worth it. Good luck!"
